One of the things I want to do more of this year is to read more non-fiction. I can devour fiction with no problem, but taking the time to read through and take something away from non-fiction has never been very easy for me. The problem I've realized is that too often I try and read non-fiction the same way as fiction, usually for 20-30 min at bedtime. Making a concerted effort to try and read and take notes is something you can't really do if you're not intentional about it. Below is a list of books that I'm currently reading that I intend to not only finish and take notes during, but also to actually do a sort of book report on here for what I'm taking away.
