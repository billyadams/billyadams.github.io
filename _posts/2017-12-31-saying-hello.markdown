It's a brand new year, well almost. Inspired by the likes of [Ross Kimes](http://rosskimes.net), [Chris Bowler](http://chrisbowler.com/journal) and others, I'm going to make an effort to write more. And one major incentive was that I could put it up here rather than it just staying in [Bear](http://bear-writer.com) and never being seen again. I'd like to write about faith, what I'm learning about life and productivity and about technology, but we'll see where this goes. Many writers and podcasters that I admire have repeatedly said that the only way to become a better writer is to write often. So that's my goal.
