[From Chris Bowler’s Weekly Review](http://chrisbowler.com/journal/fave-reads-from-2017)

> As we got closer to the end of the year, I wanted to take a moment to share the articles that inspired me the most. They cover a few of my favorite topics, ones that are discussed here regularly but are worth revisiting often.

I’ve become really grateful for guys like [Chris](http://chrisbowler.com/journal) that have done great work pulling in good content.[^1] I love the current set of “year in review” posts many writers are posting. It’s not only an opportunity to be exposed to more quality content, but it’s also an interesting window into the kind of things that inspire the writers I love to read. I’m only a few articles into this list, but my Instapaper queue is getting full fast. 

[^1]: Chris is from British Columbia, hence the superfluous “u” in favorite! Interesting that it doesn’t appear in the quoted text :-)
